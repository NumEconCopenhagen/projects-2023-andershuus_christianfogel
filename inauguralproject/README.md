# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**In this project** we analyze the relation between the men versus women wage compared to the hours worked at home. Further, we analyze how different productivity and degree of elasticity of substitution can change the results.
